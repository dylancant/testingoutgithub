\subsection*{a cell structure for $\G_{n}(\R^{m})$.}
Previously, we tried to describe the cell structure for
$\G_{n}(\R^{m})$ in terms of ``row-echelon form,'' but this approach
was fairly difficult. It was easy to describe the open 
cells in the cell structure, but proving that the closure of the open
cell are the images of maps out of a closed cell was not easy.

In these notes, we will follow Milnor's approach.
